<h2 id="tech" align="center">Technologies</h2>
JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### API:
Fake Store API.


<h2 id="how" align="center">How was made</h2>
Inspired by patterns in the interfaces of other e-commerces, both in terms of design and functionality, I focused on the presentation of products through their information and the simplicity of navigation.
</br>
I made a class in the API fetch trying to make it easier to use later, but I didn't follow SOLID's Single Responsibility Principle, although it really made it easier.
</br>
All elements was responsive since from creation for all different devices.


<h2 id="obj" align="center">Objective</h2>
Understand how different technologies (JS, Git, etc.) and concepts are combined into the same application.
