<h2 id="tech" align="center">Technologies</h2>
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### API:
Fake Store Api.


<h2 id="how" align="center">How was made</h2>
I was inspired by common things in the interface of other e-commerces and aimed to standardize the code for easy reading through order patterns, also using naming methods for functions, classes and files.
</br>
I made a class in the API fetch trying to make it easier to use later, but I didn't follow SOLID's Single Responsibility Principle, although it really made it easier.
</br>
All elements was responsive since from creation for all different devices.


<h2 id="obj" align="center">Objective</h2>
Understand how different technologies (JS, Git, etc.) and concepts are combined into the same application.
